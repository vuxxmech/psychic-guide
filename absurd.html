    <p>
      Albert Camus opened <em>The Myth of Sisyphus</em> with a sentence that has not
      aged: "There is but one truly serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide."
      He did not mean this as provocation. He meant it as diagnosis. If life has no
      inherent meaning, why continue it? The question forces everything else into
      focus, stripping away the comfortable evasions we normally live inside.
    </p>

    <p>
      Camus called the central fact of human existence the <em>absurd</em>. Not the
      universe itself, which is simply indifferent — it does not try to be meaningless.
      Not the human being either, who cannot help seeking meaning, narrative, coherence.
      The absurd is the collision between these two things: the human demand for clarity
      and the world's unreasonable silence.
    </p>

    <h2>The Shape of the Collision</h2>

    <p>
      We are, Camus observed, strange creatures. We are the only animals, as far as
      we can tell, who know that we will die and spend our lives organising experience
      into meaning rather than simply living it. We build projects, craft identities,
      invest in relationships that span decades, pursue goals that extend beyond a
      single lifetime. We act as though things matter deeply.
    </p>

    <p>
      The universe offers no confirmation of this activity. Every physical description
      of the world is third-person, quantitative, value-neutral. Physics describes
      particles, fields, forces. It does not describe significance. Chemistry describes
      reactions, bonds, energies. It does not describe loss. The languages in which we
      actually live — grief, love, hope, dread — have no counterpart at the level of
      description where the world bottoms out.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is the structural feature. It is not that life is disappointing — that the
      world has failed to live up to expectations. It is that meaning is a category
      the universe does not contain, and yet we are the kind of being that cannot
      function without it. We are built for an answer that doesn't exist.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "The absurd is born of the confrontation between the human need and the
        unreasonable silence of the world."
      </p>
      <cite>— Albert Camus, <em>The Myth of Sisyphus</em>, 1942</cite>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>The Three Responses</h2>

    <p>
      Camus identified three responses to the absurd, and found two of them dishonest.
    </p>

    <p>
      The first is physical suicide — ending the life in which the collision occurs.
      This, Camus argued, is a surrender. It acknowledges the absurd but accepts its
      terms, concluding that a life without inherent meaning is not worth living. Camus
      thought this conclusion did not follow. The absurd requires two parties: a
      consciousness that demands meaning and a world that refuses to provide it. Suicide
      destroys one party, which eliminates the confrontation but does not resolve it.
    </p>

    <p>
      The second is philosophical suicide — leaping to faith, whether religious or
      secular. This takes the confrontation with meaninglessness and resolves it by
      asserting, against the evidence, that meaning does exist: in God, in History,
      in the Dialectic, in Nature's Design. Camus found this form of hope not
      comforting but evasive — a turning away from the genuine shape of the problem
      toward the comfort of an answer the problem does not support.
    </p>

    <p>
      The third response — Camus's own — is revolt. To live fully within the
      confrontation, without pretending it is resolved and without surrendering to
      it. To acknowledge the silence and continue anyway. To insist on living in the
      face of meaninglessness, not because meaning has secretly been found, but
      because that insistence is what human dignity consists in.
    </p>

    <h2>Sisyphus Happy</h2>

    <p>
      The myth of Sisyphus, in Camus's reading, is the myth of the human condition.
      Sisyphus is condemned by the gods to roll a boulder up a hill, only to watch it
      fall back every time it nears the summit, and to descend and do it again —
      forever. The gods believed this was the worst possible punishment: endless
      futile labour with no hope of completion.
    </p>

    <p>
      Camus's intervention is to imagine Sisyphus at the moment of descent — between
      the summit where the boulder has rolled away and the base where he must begin
      again. This is his moment of consciousness, the moment when he fully knows his
      condition and must walk back down to repeat it. And Camus's conclusion, made
      with full awareness of how strange it is, is that we must imagine Sisyphus happy.
    </p>

    <p>
      Not happy despite his condition. Happy within it. Owning the rock. Owning the
      hill. The rebellion against meaninglessness performed in the very act of
      continuing to push. There is, Camus believed, a kind of joy available precisely
      in the confrontation that honest living requires — a joy not produced by
      resolution but by the quality of attention brought to an unresolvable situation.
    </p>

    <h2>Where the Horror Enters</h2>

    <p>
      Camus presented his position as a solution, but it has the structure of a horror.
      The revolt he recommends requires maintaining the confrontation rather than
      escaping it. It demands that you continue to feel the full weight of the absurd —
      the world's silence, the absence of given meaning — rather than numbing yourself
      to it or constructing a comforting narrative.
    </p>

    <p>
      Most people, most of the time, do not live this way. We manage the absurd through
      what Camus called <em>evasions</em>: routine, distraction, social identity,
      deferred meaning, ideological certainty. The examined life Socrates demanded,
      and Camus continued to demand, is one in which these evasions are not available.
      What is left is the bare confrontation — and the question of whether the
      human spirit can sustain it without looking away.
    </p>

    <p>
      Nietzsche, whose influence on Camus was deep, described the death of God not
      as triumph but as catastrophe — a loss that most people had not yet begun to
      reckon with. "There was never a greater deed," he wrote, "and whoever will be
      born after us — for the sake of this deed he will belong to a higher history
      than all history hitherto." The greatness he referred to was the demand now
      placed on human beings: to provide, from within themselves, what was previously
      provided from without.
    </p>

    <h3>What Is Left</h3>

    <p>
      The absurd cannot be solved. Camus was clear about this. The silence will not
      break. The demand for meaning will not stop. The collision between them is
      structural and permanent for as long as consciousness exists.
    </p>

    <p>
      What changes, if anything, is the quality of one's relationship to the collision.
      Whether one lives inside it with honesty, or around it with evasion. Whether
      one looks directly at the darkness or keeps it in peripheral vision. That
      difference — between looking and not looking — may be the difference between
      a human life fully lived and one carefully insulated from its own depth.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sisyphus descends. The boulder waits. The hill is the same hill it always was.
