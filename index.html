      These are not thought experiments designed to comfort. They are genuine open problems —
      questions that philosophers, physicists, and neuroscientists return to with no resolution.
      Each one contains a depth that, once felt, cannot be unfelt.

          We can explain every electrical signal in the brain. We still cannot explain why there is
          something it feels like to be you. This is not a gap waiting to be closed — it may be
          a fundamental feature of reality.

          The Second Law of Thermodynamics is not a theory — it is a mathematical certainty.

          Camus named the collision between our hunger for meaning and the universe's silence.

    <h2 class="section-title reveal" id="questions-heading">Questions With No Exit</h2>
    <p class="section-intro reveal">
      Philosophy's deepest tradition is not providing answers but staying honestly
      with the questions. These have been open for millennia — and are no closer to closing.
    </p>

    <div class="questions-grid">

      <div class="question-item reveal">
        <p class="question-text">Why is there something rather than nothing?</p>
        <p class="question-body">
          Leibniz first posed this in 1714. It remains unanswered. Every scientific explanation
          of existence presupposes something existing. The question tunnels beneath all explanation.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="question-item reveal">
        <p class="question-text">Could there be a mind that experiences nothing?</p>
        <p class="question-body">
          The philosophical zombie thought experiment asks us to imagine a being physically
          identical to you in every way but with no inner life. We cannot prove such a being does
          not exist — or that you are not one, watching a self you cannot access.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="question-item reveal">
        <p class="question-text">Is the past real?</p>
        <p class="question-body">
          Physics gives us a block universe: past, present, and future all equally real, equally
          fixed. Your memory of yesterday is not a connection to a living past — it is a
          representation in the present of a slice of spacetime that is permanent and unreachable.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="question-item reveal">
        <p class="question-text">What is the self, if not a story?</p>
        <p class="question-body">
          Hume looked inward and found only a "bundle of perceptions" — no central self, only
          a stream of experiences narrating a continuity that may not exist. The self as author
          may be indistinguishable from the self as fiction.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="question-item reveal">
        <p class="question-text">Does meaning require permanence?</p>
        <p class="question-body">
          Camus argued that recognising the absurd — the collision of our demand for meaning and
          the universe's silence — need not end in despair. But the recognition itself is the
          first step into a room with no obvious exit.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="question-item reveal">
        <p class="question-text">Is mathematics discovered or invented?</p>
        <p class="question-body">
          Mathematicians speak of results as though they were waiting to be found. Was the
          Pythagorean theorem true before anyone proved it — before humanity existed — or did
          the proof bring the truth into being? The answer reshapes what kind of world this is.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="question-item reveal">
        <p class="question-text">Could the universe have been different?</p>
        <p class="question-body">
          The physical constants — the strength of gravity, the mass of the electron — appear
          fine-tuned for the existence of complexity and life. Alter them slightly and no stars
          form, no chemistry occurs, no minds arise. Was this inevitable, chosen, or simply the
          one universe we happen to inhabit among many?
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="question-item reveal">
        <p class="question-text">Does anyone else actually exist?</p>
        <p class="question-body">
          You have precisely one direct data point for consciousness: your own experience.
          Every other mind in the world is an inference — a hypothesis you cannot verify.
          Solipsism cannot be disproved. It can only be declined, which is a different thing.
