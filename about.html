  <article class="article-body" aria-label="About the journal">

    <p>
      Horror, in the literary tradition, usually involves something that threatens the body.
      Teeth, blades, darkness in which creatures wait. That kind of horror is old and effective,
      and it trades on the most ancient parts of the nervous system — the parts that flinch,
      that freeze, that flood the blood with cortisol.
    </p>

    <p>
      Philosophical horror is something different in kind. It does not threaten the body.
      It threatens the frame through which the body perceives and interprets everything. It is
      the horror of a thought that, once had, cannot be unfelt — a reorientation so complete
      that the world you were in before seems like a different world from the one you are in now.
    </p>

    <h2>Not Edginess</h2>

    <p>
      There is a genre of writing — sometimes called "dark philosophy," sometimes nihilism-chic —
      that aims for horror by asserting hopelessness or meaninglessness in the most unqualified
      terms possible. This is not what we are doing. Unqualified assertions are not interesting.
      Despair performed for effect is not frightening; it is merely gloomy.
    </p>

    <p>
      What is genuinely frightening is a question that cannot be closed. A question where the
      most rigorous available thinking has not produced consensus, where the problem resists
      easy dissolution, where sitting with it honestly means sitting with uncertainty rather
      than resolving it into comfortable darkness or comfortable light.
    </p>

    <p>
      The hard problem of consciousness is not solved. The Fermi Paradox is not resolved.
      The questions of free will, personal identity, and the reality of the world are not
      closed. These are open problems in philosophy, physics, and cognitive science. They are
      interesting precisely because smart, serious people have spent careers on them and have
      not reached the bottom.
    </p>

    <h2>The Philosophical Tradition</h2>

    <p>
      The essays here draw on a range of thinkers: Descartes, Hume, Kant, Nietzsche,
      Schopenhauer, Camus, Wittgenstein, Parfit, Chalmers, Bostrom. They also draw on
      physics, neuroscience, and evolutionary biology. The aim is not academic survey but
      genuine inquiry — following questions where they lead, acknowledging when they do not
      resolve.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thomas Nagel, in his 1974 paper "What Is It Like to Be a Bat?", argued that there are
      aspects of subjective experience that resist any third-person, objective description.
      His conclusion was not despair. It was a kind of intellectual honesty about the limits
      of our current frameworks. That honesty is, to us, one of the most important things
      philosophy can model.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Read This</h2>

    <p>
      Philosophical horror, taken seriously, is not a comfortable genre. It asks you to sit
      with things that cannot be neatly resolved. But there is something in the serious
      confrontation with difficult questions — the acknowledgment that existence is stranger
      and more uncertain than everyday life suggests — that feels, to some people, more honest
      than the alternatives.
    </p>

    <p>
      Camus argued that the first step toward living authentically is recognising the absurd —
      the gap between our need for meaning and the world's silence. This journal is not a
      manifesto for any particular response to that gap. It is an attempt to look at the gap
      steadily, describe its dimensions accurately, and take seriously the people who have
      looked before us.
    </p>

    <p>
      Nietzsche wrote that one must have chaos within to give birth to a dancing star. We are
      not sure he was right about everything. But the chaos he described is real, and it
      deserves to be looked at directly.
