    <p>
      Descartes, in the seventeenth century, decided to doubt everything that could possibly
      be doubted. The senses, reason, memory — all of it unreliable, all of it potentially
      deceived by a malicious demon with the power to generate an entirely convincing false
      reality. The demon hypothesis was a thought experiment, a methodological device. He was
      not especially worried that it was true.
    </p>

    <p>
      In 2003, the philosopher Nick Bostrom published a paper that gave Descartes' demon a
      more precise and considerably more credible form.
    </p>

    <h2>The Trilemma</h2>

    <p>
      Bostrom's simulation argument is not simply the claim that we might be living in a
      simulation. It is a structural trilemma. At least one of the following must be true:
    </p>

    <p>
      First: virtually all civilisations at roughly our level of development go extinct before
      reaching the capacity to run detailed simulations of minds. Second: virtually all
      civilisations that reach that capacity choose not to run such simulations — for ethical
      reasons, or lack of interest, or some other consistent reason. Third: we are almost
      certainly living in a computer simulation.
    </p>

    <p>
      The argument is probabilistic. If simulations of minds are possible and are run in
      large numbers — as they almost certainly would be, given the curiosity and scale of
      any advanced civilisation — then the simulated minds would vastly outnumber the
      "base" minds. And you would have no way of knowing which kind you are.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "If there are many more simulated minds than biological minds, you should probably
        conclude that you are a simulated mind."
      </p>
      <cite>— Nick Bostrom, <em>Are You Living in a Computer Simulation?</em>, 2003</cite>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Why This Is Not Just Science Fiction</h2>

    <p>
      The simulation hypothesis is usually treated as a quirky intellectual diversion — a
      conversation topic at technology conferences, a premise for films. This treatment
      understates its seriousness.
    </p>

    <p>
      The argument's first premise — that sufficiently advanced civilisations could run
      consciousness-containing simulations — is not obviously false. It does not require
      magic or supernatural mechanisms. It requires only that consciousness is substrate-independent
      and that computation can scale arbitrarily. Neither assumption is trivially wrong. In
      fact, both are taken seriously by many philosophers and physicists.
    </p>

    <p>
      The second premise — that if such simulations are possible and not universally avoided,
      many would be run — follows straightforwardly from the nature of knowledge, curiosity,
      and the economics of computation in advanced civilisations. The histories simulated
      would vastly outnumber any base reality.
    </p>

    <p>
      The conclusion then follows from Bayesian reasoning about reference classes. If you
      are equally likely to be any conscious mind, and simulated minds outnumber non-simulated
      ones by orders of magnitude, then the probability that you are simulated is
      correspondingly high.
    </p>

    <h2>The Unfalsifiability</h2>

    <p>
      What makes the simulation hypothesis philosophically troubling is not the possibility
      that it is true. It is that it may be genuinely unfalsifiable from the inside. Any
      evidence you could cite for the "reality" of reality — the coherence of physical law,
      the reliability of your senses, the consistency of other people's reports — would be
      equally present in a sufficiently detailed simulation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some physicists have proposed that we might detect simulation artefacts — pixelation
      at the Planck scale, unexpected cutoffs in high-energy cosmic rays — but these
      proposals depend on assumptions about how the simulation is run that a sufficiently
      sophisticated simulation could trivially avoid.
    </p>

    <p>
      Karl Popper's criterion for scientific knowledge was falsifiability: a theory is
      scientific if it could, in principle, be shown to be false. The simulation hypothesis
      is structured so that no possible evidence could definitively refute it. This places
      it outside of science — not as pseudoscience, but as metaphysics in the original sense:
      a question about what lies beneath the empirical order.
    </p>

    <h2>What Would Change If It Were True</h2>

    <p>
      Here is the question that seems to matter most: if you discovered, with certainty,
      that you were living in a simulation — what would change?
    </p>

    <p>
      Your experiences would still be real experiences. Pain would still hurt. Love would
      still bind. The sun would still set in the same colours. The people around you would
      still be present in whatever sense they are present now. The value of things does not
      seem obviously to depend on the substrate that instantiates them.
    </p>

    <p>
      And yet something would shift. The sense that the world has depth — that behind
      appearances lies something solid, something ultimate — would be replaced by the
      awareness that behind appearances lies only more computation, all the way down, running
      on hardware you cannot perceive, maintained by entities you cannot contact, for purposes
      you cannot know.
    </p>

    <p>
      Descartes solved his demon problem by arguing that God would not allow such deception.
      That exit is no longer available to most people. What remains is the possibility that
      the most basic assumption underlying every other assumption — that the world is real —
      is one we cannot verify and may, by the structure of the argument, never be able to.
    </p>

    <p>
      The simulation hypothesis is not a claim. It is an aperture. Once opened, it is very
      difficult to close.
    </p>
