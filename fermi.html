    <p>
      In the summer of 1950, Enrico Fermi was walking to lunch with colleagues at Los Alamos.
      The conversation had turned, as it sometimes did in those strange postwar years, to flying
      saucers. Someone made a joke. Fermi laughed — and then asked, with the directness of a
      man who had spent his career reducing hard questions to their essential arithmetic:
      <em>"But where is everybody?"</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      That question has never been answered. It has become known as the Fermi Paradox, and
      the longer we look at it, the more unsettling it becomes.
    </p>

    <h2>The Scale of the Problem</h2>

    <p>
      The observable universe contains approximately two trillion galaxies. Our own galaxy, the
      Milky Way, contains somewhere between 100 and 400 billion stars. A substantial fraction
      of those stars host planetary systems; a substantial fraction of those systems contain
      planets in habitable zones; and life, once it arises, has had 13.8 billion years to
      develop, spread, and communicate.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even if only a tiny fraction of those planets gave rise to complex life, and only a tiny
      fraction of that life developed intelligence, and only a tiny fraction of that intelligence
      chose or was able to communicate across space — the numbers are still enormous. The
      Milky Way alone should, by conservative estimates, contain thousands of technologically
      advanced civilisations. Many of those civilisations should be millions of years older
      than ours.
    </p>

    <p>
      We should be awash in signals. We should have been visited, or colonised, long before
      Homo sapiens appeared. The night sky should be busy with evidence of minds.
    </p>

    <p>
      Instead: silence.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "The absence of evidence is not evidence of absence — except when the evidence
        should be overwhelming."
      </p>
      <cite>— Nick Bostrom, <em>Where Are They?</em>, 2002</cite>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>The Proposed Explanations</h2>

    <p>
      Many solutions to the Fermi Paradox have been proposed. They divide roughly into two
      categories: the optimistic and the catastrophic.
    </p>

    <p>
      The optimistic solutions include: interstellar distances are simply too great; advanced
      civilisations communicate in ways we cannot detect; they are observing us without
      contact; life is common but intelligence is extraordinarily rare; our search methods are
      primitive and our search time infinitesimal relative to the age of the universe.
    </p>

    <p>
      These are all possible. They are also, if we are being honest, mostly hopeful. The
      arithmetic is unforgiving. A single civilisation with even a mild interest in expansion,
      given millions of years and the mathematics of exponential growth, could colonise the
      entire Milky Way in a geologically short time — long before Earth existed as a planet.
    </p>

    <h2>The Great Filter</h2>

    <p>
      In 1998, the economist Robin Hanson introduced the concept of the <em>Great Filter</em>:
      some step in the development from simple chemistry to galaxy-spanning civilisation is
      extremely unlikely. This filter accounts for the silence. The question that follows is
      almost unbearably consequential: is that filter behind us, or ahead?
    </p>

    <p>
      If the filter is behind us — if the improbable step was the origin of life, or the
      development of eukaryotic cells, or the emergence of sexual reproduction, or something
      else in our already-accomplished past — then we may be extraordinarily rare, among the
      first civilisations in the universe to reach this point. The silence around us would
      then be the silence of a universe still waiting, not one that has already burned through
      its civilisations.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the filter is ahead of us — if there is something that consistently destroys
      technological civilisations before they can make themselves heard — then the silence
      around us is a graveyard. Every potential signal was extinguished. And we are next.
    </p>

    <h2>What the Silence Implies</h2>

    <p>
      Nick Bostrom has argued that the worst possible news in the history of science would be
      the discovery of life on Mars. Not because it would not be extraordinary — it would be
      the most significant discovery in human history. But because it would shift the
      probability mass decisively toward the filter being ahead.
    </p>

    <p>
      If life arose independently on Mars and on Earth, then the origin of life is
      relatively easy, and the filter cannot be that step. The silence then becomes much harder
      to explain — and the remaining explanations are darker. Something is waiting. Something
      in the development of technological civilisation is reliably catastrophic.
    </p>

    <p>
      The proposed candidates include: self-destruction through war or environmental collapse;
      the development of artificial intelligence that rapidly supersedes and eliminates its
      creators; a tendency for complex civilisations to turn inward — simulating experience
      rather than expanding; or something we have not imagined.
    </p>

    <h2>The Silence as a Mirror</h2>

    <p>
      There is a further dimension that is rarely discussed. The Fermi Paradox is usually
      framed as a question about <em>them</em> — about why we have not found others. But it
      is also a question about us. If civilisations reliably destroy themselves, we are a
      civilisation. If intelligence reliably reaches a point of self-annihilation, we are
      intelligence. The silence is not just an astronomical puzzle; it is a warning we
      cannot decode, from a source we cannot identify, about a danger we cannot see.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fermi's question was asked as a joke over lunch. The physicist's instinct turned it
      into a theorem. We live inside the theorem now, and we do not know the proof.
    </p>
